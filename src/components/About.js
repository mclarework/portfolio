        <p>
          I always liked the idea of working with commputers and coding.
          Something about the pure logic of the process appealed to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          In December 2019 I had the opportunity to enroll on one of Code
          Nation's Develop courses and I was right. I loved it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward a month to January 2020 and I decided to follow up the
          Develop course with a Master couse. A full immersive twelve week
          bootcamp that trains people from novice to junior technical
          profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          The course is not over yet, but I haven't looked back. I am incredibly
          passionate about learning new techniques and approaches to problems
          and find myself building small phone web apps to entertain my
          step-daughter, or sometimes just to see if I can.
